# FossaMail


FossaMail is a Thunderbird-based mail/news client building on the Pale Moon web browser core.

The source tree is mostly laid out like the Mozilla Thunderbird tree and links to Pale Moon 
as a git sub-repo for easy management and updates of the back-end code.

## Important

FossaMail is currently a discontinued product. If you want to pick up the torch, feel free
to fork this repository but **make sure you change the branding** if you plan to distribute the
client. You do not have the rights to use FossaMail's official branding.
